# Introduction to Theoretical Statistics

STATS 426 aims to introduce students to the fundamental principles and methodologies of statistical theory to upper-division undergraduate students. The course emphasizes rigorous understanding of:

- **Estimation** including techniques such as the method of moments and maximum likelihood;
- **Hypothesis testing** including confidence intervals and likelihood ratio methods;
- **Large-sample approximations** for inference;
- **Nonparametric and Bayesian methods**
- Theoretical foundations of comparing samples, linear models, categorical data and related topics.
